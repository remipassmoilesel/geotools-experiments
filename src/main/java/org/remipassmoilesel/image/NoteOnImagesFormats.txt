On the geospatial side of things there is the concept of a Coverage. A coverage is a collection of spatially located features. Informally, we equate a coverage with a map (in the geographic rather than the programming sense).

A GridCoverage is a special case of Coverage where the features are rectangles forming a grid that fills the area of the coverage. In our Java code we can use a bitmapped graphic as the backing data structure for a GridCoverage together with additional elements to record spatial bounds in a specific coordinate reference system.

There are many kinds of grid coverage file formats. Some of the most common are:

world plus image

    A normal image format like jpeg or png that has a side-car file describing where it is located as well as a prj sidecar file defining the map projection just like a shapefile uses.

    Please note that alothough the jpeg format is common due to small download size; the performance at runtime is terrible as the entire image needs be read into memory. Formats such as TIFF do not have this limitation,


Geotiff

    A normal tiff image that has geospatial information stored in the image metadata fields. This is generally a safe bet for fast performnace; especially if it has been prepaired with an internal overlay (which can be used when zoomed out) or internal tiling (allowing for fast pans when zoomed in.

    Performs best when your computer has faster disks than CPUs.


JPEG2000

    The sequel to jpeg that uses wavelet compression to handle massive images. The file format also supports metadata fields that can be used to store geospatial information.

    This format performs best when you have more faster CPUs than disk access.

There are also more exotic formats such as ECW and MRSID that can be supported if you have installed the imageio-ext project into your JRE.
